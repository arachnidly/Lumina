# Lumina-v1

Lumina is a library management web app created for the Modern Application Development - I project.

[Lumina-v1](https://github.com/aradhanachatterjee/Lumina-v1) is the repository where I built the app and used version control to manage the project.

The 71st commit reflects the state of the project directory that was submitted for evaluation (without the Books subfolder in the static folder which was added in a subsequent commit after previously having been in the gitignore list).

The project received a final score of 100. [See also](https://app.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/document_verification/a46b2bfaa759ee837e9118c03e25758e)

## Pleasant Surprise:

The result section of the project submission portal had an empty score card throughout the term, and the final score was revealed on the student dashboard, as usual.

I'm so glad that the project team chose this term to merge the MAD-1 and MAD-2 project submission portals, because I stumbled upon the updated score card by accidentally clicking on the Result tab instead of Study Resources and also forgetting to choose MAD1 Jan 2024 in the drop down list, just out of habit.

Project Result:

| **Level1 Marks** | **Level2 Marks** | **Total Marks** |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
|       40.0       |       55.0       |       95.0      |

I have many ideas where I could've lost the marks, but this isn't about that.

In my opinion, the final course grade for a course is what it is. What I care about after I complete the course is did I have a fun learning experience? Did I learn?????

The answer is very much yes. I'm proud of this particular S grade from a score of 95, and prior to capping, a score of 114 out of 120.

## Acknowledgments

I must express my sincerest gratitude to Prof. Nitin Sir for his lectures, Thejesh Sir for his screencasts, the course instructor Adarsh Sir for his live sessions dealing with specific concepts and implementations and also for answering every single question in the project group, and my level2 viva examiner Sir, who was extremely kind and patient and incredibly professional.
